Place all Retail POS customizations to services and triggers, as well as any added code in this folder. If you use this folder you don’t need to replace or remove existing services or triggers from their respective folders. Single instance interfaces (such as ICustomer) use this folder first for loading interface implementations. Multi-instance interfaces (such as IBlankOperation or any of the trigger interfaces) load both the interfaces in this folder and the interfaces in the core implementation.
